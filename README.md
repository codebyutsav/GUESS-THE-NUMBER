## 🧠 About the Game

This is a fun and interactive **Number Guessing Game** built using Python 🐍.  
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and your task is to guess it with as few attempts as possible. After each guess, you'll get a helpful hint:

- 🔼 **"Higher number de bhai"** – Your guess is too low  
- 🔽 **"Lower number de bhai"** – Your guess is too high  

The game keeps track of the number of guesses you make until you find the correct number.
